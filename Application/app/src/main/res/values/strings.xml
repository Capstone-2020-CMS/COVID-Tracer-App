        The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to common illnesses such as a cold or influenza. You may have one or more of the following:\n
        \n- a new or worsening cough
        \n- fever (at least 38˚C)
        \n- shortness of breath
        \n- a sore throat
        \n- sneezing and runny nose
        \n- temporary loss of smell\n
        \nShortness of breath is a sign of possible pneumonia and requires immediate medical attention.\n
        \nSome people may present with less typical symptoms such as only: fever, diarrhoea, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), nausea/vomiting, or confusion/irritability.\n
        \nSymptoms can take up to 14 days to show after a person has been infected. The virus can be passed onto others before they know they have it – from up to two days before symptoms develop.\n
        \nIf you have these symptoms call Healthline (for free) on 0800 358 5453 or your doctor immediately.
